The given code is already quite clean and follows many best practices. However, there are a few small improvements that can be made:

1. Use docstrings properly: Docstrings should explain what the function does, its arguments, and its return values. In this case, the functions are simple enough that they don't need extensive documentation, but it's a good practice to follow.

2. Use a more descriptive function name: The function name 'display_greeting' could be more descriptive. A better name might be 'print_greeting_message'.

3. Use return statements: Even though the function 'print_greeting_message' does not return anything, it's a good practice to include a return statement at the end of every function. This makes it clear that the function is intended to return nothing.

Here's the improved code:

```python
def print_greeting_message():
    """
    Prints a greeting message to the console.

    Args: None

    Returns: None
    """
    print("Hello, World!")
    return None

def main():
    """
    Main function that serves as the entry point to the program.

    Args: None

    Returns: None
    """
    print_greeting_message()
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: The above changes are quite minor and might not be necessary depending on your coding style and the complexity of your program. The original code was already quite good.
