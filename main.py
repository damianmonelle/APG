The code is well-written and follows most of the best practices. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:


1. Use docstrings: The existing comments can be converted into docstrings to provide more information about what the function does. Docstrings are a type of comment used in Python that is placed immediately after the function definition. They are enclosed in triple quotes and can span multiple lines.

2. Use of the __name__ == "__main__" idiom: This idiom is used to ensure that the main function is executed only when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module. This is a good practice to follow.

3. Function naming: The function names are descriptive and follow the lower case with underscores naming convention, which is a good practice in Python.

4. Comments: The comments are clear and helpful, explaining what each part of the code does.

Here is the refined code:

```python
def display_greeting():
    """
    Function to display a greeting message.
    """
    print("Hello, World!")

def main():
    """
    Main function that serves as the entry point to the program.
    Executes the display_greeting function.
    """
    display_greeting()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the refined code, the unnecessary comment "Call the main function if this script is executed directly" is removed as it is self-explanatory from the if __name__ == "__main__": statement. The rest of the code is already following the best practices.
