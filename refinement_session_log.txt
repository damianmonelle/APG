``````python
def display_welcome_message() -> None:
    """Displays a welcome message."""
    print("Hello, World!")

def main() -> None:
    """Main function to initiate the program."""
    display_welcome_message()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
``````

Summary: As per best practices, the main function should be used to initiate the program and the specific tasks should be delegated to separate functions. Hence, the task of displaying the welcome message has been moved to a separate function named `display_welcome_message()`. The main function now calls this function to display the welcome message. This improves readability and maintainability.

Raw OpenAI Response:
Summary: The updates were restructured for consistency, clarity, and readability. The format was standardized across all the updates. The 'Changes' and 'Summary' sections were merged into a single section to avoid redundancy. The placeholders for dates were standardized. The last changelog entry was removed as it was a duplicate.

Summary: The provided python file is already following the best practices for python coding. The functions are well documented with docstrings, type hinting is used for function parameters and return types and the code is readable and maintainable. Therefore, no changes were necessary.

class Operation(Enum):
    ADD = "add"

    Operation.ADD: lambda x, y: x + y,

        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
``````

Summary: 
The functionality of the provided code was already optimal, and the readability was mostly good. The only improvement I made was in the `perform_operation` function. Instead of catching a `KeyError` when an unsupported operation is used, I've changed it to explicitly check if the operation is in the `OPERATIONS` dictionary and raise a `ValueError` if it's not. This makes the code slightly more readable, as it's clear that an unsupported operation is the reason for the exception. This is also a better practice as it prevents the possibility of masking other `KeyError` exceptions that might be raised for unrelated reasons.
