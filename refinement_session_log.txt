def main() -> None:
    """Main function to initiate the program."""
    display_welcome_message()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
``````

Summary: As per best practices, the main function should be used to initiate the program and the specific tasks should be delegated to separate functions. Hence, the task of displaying the welcome message has been moved to a separate function named `display_welcome_message()`. The main function now calls this function to display the welcome message. This improves readability and maintainability.

Summary: The updates were restructured for consistency, clarity, and readability. The format was standardized across all the updates. The 'Changes' and 'Summary' sections were merged into a single section to avoid redundancy. The placeholders for dates were standardized. The last changelog entry was removed as it was a duplicate.

Summary: The provided python file is already following the best practices for python coding. The functions are well documented with docstrings, type hinting is used for function parameters and return types and the code is readable and maintainable. Therefore, no changes were necessary.

``````

Summary: 
The functionality of the provided code was already optimal, and the readability was mostly good. The only improvement I made was in the `perform_operation` function. Instead of catching a `KeyError` when an unsupported operation is used, I've changed it to explicitly check if the operation is in the `OPERATIONS` dictionary and raise a `ValueError` if it's not. This makes the code slightly more readable, as it's clear that an unsupported operation is the reason for the exception. This is also a better practice as it prevents the possibility of masking other `KeyError` exceptions that might be raised for unrelated reasons.

Summary: The Python code was already quite clean and followed good practices. The only changes made were to the docstrings to make them more concise. Specifically, "Displays a welcome message." was changed to "Display a welcome message." and "Main function to initiate the program." was changed to "Initiate the program.". The functionality and readability of the code remain the same.

Summary: 
The changes made were primarily to improve the readability and consistency of the markdown file. The formatting of the dates was made consistent, and the unnecessary "Changelog" headings were removed. The "Changes" section was also made consistent with the "Added", "Updated", and "Removed" sections in the first update. Lastly, the "Summary" sections were removed from the updates with unspecified dates, as they lacked any specific details.

--- File: C:\AI_Project_Generator\build\APG\src\utils.py ---
Raw OpenAI Response:
Summary: The code was already quite clean and followed good practices. I only made a slight change to the 'calculate_average' function to make it more pythonic by checking if the list is empty at the beginning of the function. This way, we avoid unnecessary checks for the type of elements in an empty list.

Summary:
The provided python code is already well-structured and follows best practices for readability and functionality. It's hard to improve it further because it's already quite good. It includes type hints, uses an Enum for operations, and has clear, concise functions. There are no unnecessary comments, and the variable and function names are descriptive. The use of a dictionary to map operations to their functions is a good example of using Python's dynamic features. The error handling in the perform_operation function is also good, as it raises a ValueError when an unsupported operation is passed. The code also includes a validation function to check if a number is an integer, which is used in the is_even and is_prime functions.
