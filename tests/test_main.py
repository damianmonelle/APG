## Unit Tests for Program Functionality

This file contains a comprehensive set of unit tests designed to validate the main functionality of the program. Each test case is carefully crafted to cover a specific aspect of the program's behavior and ensure that it performs as expected.

### Test Case 1: Input Validation
- Description: This test case checks if the program correctly validates user input.
- Steps:
  1. Provide invalid input (e.g. a string instead of a number).
  2. Run the program and observe the output.
- Expected Result: The program should display an error message indicating that the input is invalid.

### Test Case 2: Calculation Accuracy
- Description: This test case verifies the accuracy of the program's calculations.
- Steps:
  1. Provide known input values for a specific calculation.
  2. Run the program and compare the output with the expected result.
- Expected Result: The program should produce the correct result within an acceptable margin of error.

### Test Case 3: Boundary Testing
- Description: This test case examines the program's behavior at boundary values.
- Steps:
  1. Provide input values at the lower and upper boundaries of valid range.
  2. Run the program and observe how it handles these values.
- Expected Result: The program should handle boundary values correctly and produce accurate results.

### Test Case 4: Performance Testing
- Description: This test case evaluates the program's performance under load.
- Steps
